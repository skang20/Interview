          Why do you want to design?
    				</summary>

			<p>I love creating. Design gives me excitement. Everytime I
      design something whether a poster, an album cover or a
      painting, I feel accompished. Art is fun and beautiful. Without
      art, the world is such a boring place so I want to contribute
      beautiful creations for it. I studied bussiness in university but
      found it’s tedious. That’s why I changed my major, and so far I
      think I made the right choice.</p>

		What is diffcult or frustrating for you within design and
how do you work to push past that?
</summary>
			<p>First, the most diffcult is my lack of drawing and adobe programs
      skills. As I said, I don’t have much experience with
      graphic design so I find it pretty hard to hand draw and use
      design programs like photoshop and illustrator. So to push
      past that, I try to pratice whenever I can and I think I’m getting
      better. Second, the lack of inspiration sometimes. I conquer
      that I go online to look at other peope’s works and that
      helps a lot.</p>

          What do you see yourself doing after you fnish this program?
</summary>
      <p>Anything. I would love to accept anything that is given to me.
      As someone who just graduate, I don’t think I should be
      picky. I need experiences in the real world and maybe after
      that I can decide what I would like to do as a profession.</p>
